PyBaSiC - Background and Shading Correction of Optical Microscopy Images in Python
==================================================================================

**PyBaSiC** is a microscopy image correction package in python (Matlab version can be found `here`_). 
It achieves high-accuracy with significantly fewer input images, and works for diverse imaging conditions 
with no manual parameters required. Moreover, PyBaSiC can correct temporal drift 
in time-lapse microscopy data and thus improve continuous single-cell quantification. You can also find PyBaSiC as a `Fiji/ImageJ plugin`_.
